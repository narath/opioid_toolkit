This Toolkit is a collection of documents, links and templates that we have used in our work at the [Brigham and Women's Hospital Phyllis Jen Center for Primary Care](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/medicine/general-internal-medicine-and-primary-care/phyllis-jen-primary-care-center/overview) development of a management system for patients who are being prescribed chronic opioid therapy. You can learn more about our work through our poster presentation for [Academy Health Research Meeting](http://bit.ly/2URTHTr), or by contacting me.
